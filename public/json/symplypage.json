    "I'm ONE 0000 0001. I run several experimental electronic music projects. My main project is ONE HUMAN FACTOR which is a mix of electronic music and noise. The second one is DRONOISIUM wich is a drone music project tht goes from hypnotic drone to Harsh Noise Wall. The third one is Fetishground which I started as Fleshware. The debut album is a kind of oppressive electro pop and the EPs are ambiant.",
    "I like to make videos for my tracks.",
    "Below, you'll find some videos and links to the websites of those projects."
