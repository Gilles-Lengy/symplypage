# Symplypage

I've created Symplypage to manage one single page websites that I'm going to use to present some of my personnal projects. For me is a good way to pratice Symfony5 what I learned throught Symfonycast.

For now it's a POC.

When it'll be more advanced, with a contact form and a possibly a way to easily custom css, I'll explain how to install it and use it.
